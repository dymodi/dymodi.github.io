## Reading
I enjoy reading books and here are some books I really want to share with others. I put a simple comment after the book name.

Stefan Zweig, *The World of Yesterday: Memoires of a European* - Future has always been written in the history.

Stefan Zweig, *Decisive Moments in History* - Decisions at some moments impact your whole life and even the history.

Gabriel García Márquez, *Living to Tell the Tale* - Life itself is a story.

Gabriel García Márquez, *Love in the Time of Cholera*- Great book on love.

Haruki Murakami, *Kafka on the Shore* - Some of my view and life and humanity is triggered by Murakami's novels.

Erich Maria Remarque, *All Quiet on the Western Front* - We shall never fall into the fever for wars.

Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, *The Makioka Sisters* - Make youself comfortable in a chair and read the story of four sisiters.

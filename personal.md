I enjoy traveling and reading in my spare time.

## Traveling  <a name="sometext"></a>

I like to travel to different places in my spare time. I also like photography and aerial photography.

## Reading
I enjoy reading books, and here are some books I really want to share with others. I put a simple comment after the book's name.

Hermann Hesse, *Demian: The Story of Emil Sinclair's Youth*, I wanted only to live in accord with the promptings which came from my true self. Why was that so very difficult?

Hermann Hesse, *Narcissus and Goldmund* - Find yourself and be, instead of being someone else.

Hermann Hesse, *Steppenwolf* - Finding someone's self is a long and tough trip.

Stefan Zweig, *The World of Yesterday: Memoires of a European* - Future has always been written in history.

Stefan Zweig, *Decisive Moments in History* - Decisions at some moments impact your whole life and even history.

Gabriel García Márquez, *Living to Tell the Tale* - Life itself is a story.

Gabriel García Márquez, *Love in the Time of Cholera* - A great book on love.

Haruki Murakami, *Kafka on the Shore* -  Murakami's novels formed some of my views on life and humanity.

Erich Maria Remarque, *All Quiet on the Western Front* - We shall never fall into the fever for wars.

Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, *The Makioka Sisters* - Make yourself comfortable in a chair and read the story of four sisters.

# Related Works of Location Privacy

A common conclusion is that user trace can be recovered from very little trace leakage, published mobility data has privacy vulnerabilities even with anonymization [MobiCom10, MobiCom11, SciRep13, WWW17].



Many Location-Privacy Protection Mechanisms (**LPPM**s) have been proposed on this topic [MobiSys14, KDD14, INFOCOM14, SIGSPATIAL15-PLACE].

Location Privacy is quantified in [IEEESSP11].

*k*-anonymity: is a property possessed by certain anonymized data.



**Detailed Reviews**

* MobiCom10: Privacy Vulnerability of Published Anonymous Mobility Traces
  * Summary: Even anonymous published mobility trace data has privacy vulnerabilities due to spatial-temporal correlations.
  
* Ubicomp10: Exploring End User Preferences for Location Obfuscation
  * Summary: Visualization and questionnaire survey on 32 GPS data, showing that privacy protection awarenesses is lacking among people
  
* MobiCom11: Anonymization of Location Data Does Not Work
  * Summary: As title indicates.
  
* IEEESSP11: Quantifying Location Privacy
  * Summary: Many LPPMs are proposed, but unified metric is missing to measure location privacy and performance of LPPMs. Metric is proposed in this paper.
  
* SciRep13: The privacy bounds of human mobility
  * Summary: Uniqueness in human mobility is bounded, it's easy to infer user trace.
  
* MobiSys14-EnCore: Private, Context-based Communication for Mobile Social Apps
  * Taxonomy: LPPM in application
  * Summary: New LPPM for social-networking APP,

* KDD14: Privacy Preserving Release of Spatio-temporal Density in Paris
  * Taxonomy: LPPM in data releasing
  * Summary: New LPPM is provided in data release with differential privacy.

* INFOCOM14-DLS: Achieving k-anonymity in Privacy-Aware Location-Based Services
  * Taxonomy: LPPM
  * Summary: Introducing dummy locations.

* SIGSPATIAL15-PLACE: Privacy-Preserving Inference of Social Relationships from Location Data
  * Taxonomy: LPPM in computing
  * Summary: An framework is envisioned to preserve the priivacy when inferring social relations.

* WWW17: User Privacy Is NOT Preserved in Aggregated Mobility Data
  * Summary: Same scope as [MobiCom10], [MobiCom1] and [SciRep13].

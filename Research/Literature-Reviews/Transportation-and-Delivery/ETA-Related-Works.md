* Doing in One Go: Delivery Time Inference Based on Couriersâ€™ Trajectories *[KDD 2020 JD]*
  * **Taxonomy**: Express, Delivery Time, 
  * **Contributions**:
    * Conceptual: present the first attempt to formalize the delivery time infer- ence problem.
    * Application: the system is deployed in JD Logistics and used internally.
  * The motivation of is to "*ease the burdens on the couriers*".
  * Straightforward solution: extract staying point.
    * Limitation of straightforward solutions: mismatch between noisy staying points and geocoded locations.
  * Proposed solutions: (1) Data Pre-processing (trajectory parsing); (2) Delivery Location Correction; (3) Delivery Event-based Matching;

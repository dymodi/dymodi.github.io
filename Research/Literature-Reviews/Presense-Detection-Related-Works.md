# Related Works of Presence Detection


Here we have a brief summary of works related to presense detection.

In [1], the authors present IODetector, a lightweight sensing service which runs on the mobile phone and detects the indoor/outdoor environment in a fast, accurate, and efficient manner. An important feature of IODetector is that IODetector assumes no prior knowledge (e.g., fingerprints) of the environment and uses only on-board sen- sors common to mainstream mobile phones. (We also have this feature in our arrival/departure detection application.) **However**, this service can only detect whether the cellphone is indoor or outdoor but cannot give more specific information regarding to the position of the device.

[2] provides PANDAA, a system that uses ambient sounds to decide the arrangment of the multiple networked devices. **However**, the system depends  on the accurately placement of the devices and can only sense the layout of the environment but cannot match the device to a specific POI. (Such as a rider-shop pair.)

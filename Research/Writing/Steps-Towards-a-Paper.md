### 1. Come up with the Idea

* Shoot first, then make the target.
  * Sometimes we have a good problem and try to find a good solution to it. Sometimes we have a good solution and we need to find a **good problem** for it. Or you can call it, make target after shooting.
* The key infomation of the top research is usually a **claim**, **a special problem can be solved with a special method**. We need be able to delivery this simple but clear information.
* From Desheng, there are two types of problems for system paper.
  * Measurement and prediction (like route prediction of Yan Zhang). It is easier to design and evaluation since you have the ground truth of results. While it may needs more effort to persuade the reviewers.
  * Inference (like localization), where we do not have the ground truth while we try to infer it from some data we have (GPS, timestamp). While in the Evaluation section, we use another system (beacons) to show the performance of our design and this "another system" is not aforementioned. The Design section and Evaluation must be isolated. (Keep in mind that the system in Design and Evaluation can be  exchanged)
* Before talk to others, remember the following checklist:
  * Have you found the key innovation of the project? Why others cannot solve but you can?
  * It will be better that a idea come with an special observation.
  * Have you  give thorough consideration and dig deep into the problem?
  * You have seen a similar topic does not mean this idea would be appreciated. 
  * Professor has a higher requirement: **top paper** but not normal paper.
  * Is this work a simple piling of two or more ideas?
  * Is this topic already studied by others? Can you articulate your innovation?

### 2. Discuss with Professor

* Scope
  * The problem you want to solve and the solution you provide must be generic, e.g. instant delivery but not food delivery.
  * The experiments and evaluation you did can be only a subset or a special case of you scope, e.g. we test dispatching algorithm on a grid in ELE.ME platform.
* Innovation
  * Instead of list several innovations, it will be better to articulate one major difference or innovation.
* Motivation
  * Motivation must be shown with statistics and simple stories.
* Solution
  * The key point of solutions must be corresponds to the key points in motivation section.
  * The problems discussed in the challenge section must be solved.
  * The golden key found in opportunities section must be utilized in the solution.
  * Sometimes we can prepared the raw data first, uncover the pattern in the raw data and find the corresponding solution.
  * Another advantage of preparing data first is that we can immediately try our new idea on the data if we have new thoughts.
  * Instead of manipulate a very complex method with many components and parameters, it will be better to design a simple system with one major innovative part and show that is working.
  * Instead of coming up with brand new solutions, it will be better to import existing solutions.
* Advanced Design
  - Discover and solve the advanced problem by removing the assumptions. For example, if we do not assume that rider are walking at a constant speed (1m/s) indoor, the problem will become more complexity.
* Before study, remember the following checklist:
  * Make sure the whole project (motivation, problem, solution, advanced design, evaluation) is accepted by the Professor.
  * Every time discussing with Professor, remember to refer to the whole framework and the differences between two version of slides.

### 3. Study

* Prepare data to have a whole image of the data and problem.
* Find well-known methods in the field as baseline.
* For each related topic, prepare a survey to learn this field and make ready for the Related Works of the paper.

### 5. Writing

Paper can be drafted based on the slides used for discussion with Professor. A specialized slides can be use to keep the main stuff for the paper. It will be better that Sections (even subsections and subsubsections) designed clearly and carefully before start writing.

For System Paper writing, please find guides in this [post](https://github.com/dymodi/dymodi.github.io/blob/master/Research/Writing/How-to-Write-a-System-Paper.md).

### 6. Revise

* Put contents as much as possible regardless of the page limit, it will easier to drop than add contents in the final hours.
* Better complete a draft two or more weeks before DDL and send out to others (Professor, co-authors, etc) for comments
* Comments should  from people who are farmiliar as well as **unfamiliar** to this topic.
* Outline the revising points from the comments and discuss with them.
* Revise the draft and re-do the first step.

### 7. Presentation

* When others ask questions, try to find out why they ask "this" question.

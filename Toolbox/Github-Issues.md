## Keeping a fork up to date 
[Keeping a fork up to date](https://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435)
1.  Clone your fork:
```
    git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPO.git
```
2. Add remote from original repository in your forked repository: 
```
    cd into/cloned/fork-repo
    git remote add upstream git://github.com/ORIGINAL-DEV-USERNAME/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git
    git fetch upstream
```
3. Updating your fork from original repo to keep up with their changes:
```
    git pull upstream master
```

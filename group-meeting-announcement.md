For the group meeting next week (2/20, 9am CST), there will be two agenda:

1. @Xiao Yan will give us a detailed presentation on how he implemented different modalities in his recent experiment, including acoustic, Wi-Fi, IMU, and camera. Useful experiences like the tool he used, how to use raspberry Pi hardware, how the fragmented data are processed, how the AI model is used will be introduced. The purpose is not to criticize the research part, but to learn the technical/engineering experiences.

2. The wifi2sate team (@Xiao Yan @Buvana Seshathri @Tushar Wani @Cyril Zhang) will give a progress report on the wifi2satellite project. 

Note that the meeting requires in-person participation for students at UTD (Room: ECSS 3.910.)

1. @Xiao Yan will give us a detailed presentation on how he implemented different modalities in his recent experiment, including acoustic, Wi-Fi, IMU, and camera. Useful experiences like the tool he used, how to use raspberry Pi hardware, how the fragmented data are processed, how the AI model is used will be introduced. The purpose is not to criticize the research part, but to learn the technical/engineering experiences.

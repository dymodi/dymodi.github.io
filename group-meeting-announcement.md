For the group meeting next week (2/27, 9am CST), there will be one agenda:

1. Jia Li from Prof. Yapeng Tian's group will give us a presentation on her recent and current work. The presentation can help us understand Yapeng's group's recent work on AR so we can collaborate on AI-assisted AR sensing. @Lokesh Balasubramaniam please be sure to attend as it's related to your master thesis.

Note that the meeting requires in-person participation for students at UTD (Room: ECSS 3.910.)

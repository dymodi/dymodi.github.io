For next week's (2/6) group meeting, @Ziqi Liu will report the progress of our project on data value in wild life monitoring in collaboration with Sara. This project can be a good example where we refine the idea/problem rapidly with preliminary experiment results and discussion with collaborators.

Note that the meeting requires in-person participation for students at UTD (Room: ECSS 3.910.)

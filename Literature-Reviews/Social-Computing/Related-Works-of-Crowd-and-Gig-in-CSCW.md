**Key Words:** Crowd, Gig

**Taxonomy**

* Crowdsourcing Types: Collaborative
* Data: Experiments, Survey, Participant Observations, Interview, Public Data.
* Solution Proposed: 
* Evaluation: Real-world Experiments
* Research Scheme: Empirical, Data-Driven, 

**Comments**

* [CSCW19-Fiverr] has a short and quick survey on gig economy.
* [CSCW19-Upwork] has a moderate survey on the "Information and Power Asymmetries in the Gig Economy"
* [CSCW21-Quality] and [CSCW21-Crowdsensing] are system design.
* [CSCW19-Fiverr] and [CSCW21-Quality] are based on existing data-sets (instead of interview, survey, or experiments).

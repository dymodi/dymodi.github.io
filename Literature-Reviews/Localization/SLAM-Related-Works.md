**Key Words**: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

**Taxonomy**

* Methods: 
  * Kalman filter (high computational complexity. [AAAI-2002-FastSLAM]);
  * Particle filter;
* Data Source: 
  * mmWave Radar;
  * Mobile phone sensor (Wi-Fi, Mag., Acc., Gyro.)

**Comments**

* SLAM applications:
  * Applications in all scenarios in which a prior map is not available and needs to be built [IEEE-2016-Tutorial].
* Basic assumptions in SLAM [IEEE-2001-TRA]:
  * The robot equipped with a sensor capable of making measurements of the landmark's locations relative to the robot.
  * The vehicle starts at an unknown location with no knowledge of the location of landmarks in the environment.
  * The kinematic model of the robot is known (direction/speed/distance).
  * The absolute locations of the landmarks are not available.
  * The landmarks are stationary.
  * As the robot moves through the environment (in a stochastic manner) it makes relative observations of the landmarks' location.
* Differences compared with couriers' indoor localization.
  * The kinematic model (direction/speed/distance) of the couriers are unknown. Dead reckoning is impossible duo to high-sampling rate unacceptable.

**Papers**

* A Solution to the Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) Problem, *[IEEE-2001-TRA]*, *Highly-cited.* 
  * Taxonomy: Kalman filter; mmWave Radar;
  * Important conclusions:
    * Shows that a converged solution of SLAM is possible.
    * Given the exact location of any one landmark, the location of any other landmark in the map can also be determined with absolute certainty.
* FastSLAM, *[AAAI-2002-FastSLAM],* *Highly-cited.* 
  * Taxonomy: Particle filter;
  * Acceleterate SLAM with a new algorithm.
* Simultaneous Localization and Mapping: Part I, *[IEEE-2006-Tutorial-1]*, *Highly-cited.* 
  * Tutorial paper. Brief introduction of the SLAM history, formulation and solution.
* Simultaneous localization and Mapping (SLAM): Part II, *[IEEE-2006-Tutorial-2]*, *Highly-cited.* 
  * Tutorial paper. Focus on computational complexity, data association, and environment representation.
* SemanticSLAM, *[IEEE-2016-SemanticSLAM]*
  * Taxonomy: Particle filter, Mobile phone sensors.
  * Leverages the idea that certain locations in an indoor environment have a unique signature on one or more phone sensors.
  * Floorplan needed. 
  * Dead reckoning used to estimated user's kinematic.
* Past, Present, and Future of SLAM, *[IEEE-2016-Tutorial]*, *Highly-cited.* 
  * Very good tutorial/survey paper on the recent progress of SLAM. 
  * Explore the third age of SLAM-- robust perception age -- based on the summary of previous works.
  * The impact of deep learning is also discussed in the paper.

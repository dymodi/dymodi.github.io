**Keywords:** Location Mining/Prediction



**Comments**

- *Stay Point Detection* is defined in [IEEE TIST-15] and some basic methods are introduced.
- In location prediction, usually we need first find out the frequently visited places in mobility history.



**Taxonomy**

* Frequent place mining methods: Sequential pattern mining
* Location prediction methods:



**Individual Papers**

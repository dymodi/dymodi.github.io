title: Related Works of Context-Aware Computing

In another [survey](https://dymodi.github.io/Research/Literature-Reviews/Sensing/Scene-Ambience-Sensing-Monitoring-Related-Works), we only focus on single-source context sensing without complete application solution. We need broaden the scope and try to find more related works on multi-source sensor with complete upper layer application.

In this survey, we focus on the context-aware computing, which was a individual research field.



**Key Words**

* **Context**: any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and applications themselves [IEEEIoTJ18-Survey].
* **Context-aware computing**
* **Context lifecycle**: Context Acquisition -> Context Modeling -> Context Reasoning -> Context Dissemination
* **Context modeling** (Context representation): 
  * A context model is to define and store context data in a machine processable form.
  * Context modeling is defined as the context representation that provides assistance in the under standing of properties, relationship, and details of context
  * Models: Key-Value models, Logic based models, Ontology based models
* **Context reasoning**:
  * The inference (reasoning) process can be used to derive new facts based on existing rules in the systems. 
  * Context reasoning can be defined as a method of deducing new knowledge, and understanding better, based on the available context. It can also be explained as a process of giving high-level context deductions from a set of contexts [IEEECST14-Survey].



**Taxonomy**

* Application: Navigation, Shopping Assistant, Conference Assistant
* Context: User Location, User activity, Device placement, 
* Sensor: GPS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Camera, Magnetometer
* Solution: Machine learning,

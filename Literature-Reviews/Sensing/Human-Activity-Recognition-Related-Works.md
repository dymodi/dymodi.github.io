"Transportation/Mobiliy Mode" and "Activity Recognition" are two very related topics, since many studies consider "Walk/Run" as activities.

In this survey, I mainly focus on courier-related activities/mobilities (e.g. walk/riding) while ignoring other activities/mobilities (e.g. car/bus/keystroke).



**Keyword**

* Activity Recognition

* Transportation/Mobiliy Mode


**Taxonomy**

* Data Source: CDR, IMU, Acc.
* Sampling Rate: 100Hz, 5/16/50/100Hz, 10Hz, 
* Methods: ML, HMM, 

**Comments**

* *Sampling Rate* is one of the key barriers when applying the methods

**Papers**

* ISWC12: Energy Efficiency
  * Acc., 5/16/50/100Hz, ML
  * Trade-off between sampling frequence and classification performance.

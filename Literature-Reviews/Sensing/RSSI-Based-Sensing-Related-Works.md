**Taxonomy**

* RSSI-based Features: 
  * Time related features (e.g., period of slope)
  * Statistical features (e.g, peak, mean, variance)
  * Frequency related features (e.g. low-pass filter, high-pass filter, spectral energy, entropy)
  * Edge features (e.g., rising edge, falling edge)
  * Histogram (i.e., the signal distribution)
  * Correlation (e.g., spearman, Pearson)
  * Distance (e.g., manhattan, euclidean)
* Sensing Objects: Localization, Presence Detection (Coarse-grained), Activity Recognition (Fine-grained)
* Methods: Filtering (with threshold), ML (e.g. KNN, SVM, Bayesian Network), Wavelet Transform
* Another taxonomy can be "Device-based" and "Device-free"

**Comments**

* Tracking Human Queues[MobiSys14] has a very detailed description of what are derived from RSSI raw data and used as feature for following sensing.

* Although [MobiCom15-Understanding] is a CSI based work, there is a good survey on the RSSI-based human activity recognition topic. But the survey here is to citing some RSSI-based works and show their performance defects compared with (author's) CSI-based work.

* There is also a survey on RSSI-based sensing in [IMWUT17-Detecting] and [MobiCom15-Keystroke].

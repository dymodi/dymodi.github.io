**Comments**

**Individual Papers**

* Crowdphysics, *AAAI 2013*
  * Taxonomy: Twitter data, Graph
  * One of leading work in crowd delivery. Crowd physics is a more generic topic than crowd delivery. 
* TaxiExp, *IEEE 2014*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi, No time constraints, No transfers
  * Two phases, offline + online
* Towards City-scale Mobile Crowdsourcing, *IJCAI 2015*
  * Taxonomy: No data, No time constraints, No transfers
  * Theoretical analysis and routing algorithm, no transportation data or evaluation.
* CrowdDeliver, *IEEE ITS 2016*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi, No time constraints, No transfers
  * Two phases: offline mining historical OD pairs + online taxi scheduling
* Towards enhancing the last-mile delivery, *TRPE 2016*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi and bus, No time constraints, No transfers
  * Modeled as a min-cost flow problem. Bus data are used to model mobility but not as a delivery approach.
* Understanding and assessing crowd logistics business models, *JBIM 2017*
  * Taxonomy: Theoretical sutdy
  * Survey of industrial point of view
* A crowdsource-enabled system for urban parcel relay and delivery, *TRPB 2017*
  * Taxonomy: Truck+Cyclist (Pedestrians)
* Multi-hop driver-parcel matching problem with time windows, *Springer Flex Serv Manuf J 2018*
  * Taxonomy:  Private cars, With time constraints, No transfers,  Heuristic on ILP
  * Good writing on background and related works.
* FooDNet, *IEEE TMC 2018*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi, No transfer, With time constraints
  * Contributions: (1) First work on food delivery with taxis;
* CrowDNet, *IEEE IoT Journal 2019*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi, No tranfers, No time constraints
  * Contribution: Delivery path recommendation based on model portfolio theory.
* Crowdsourced Public Transportation Systems (CPTSs), *IEEE IoT Journal 2019*
  * Taxonomy: Public transport, No time constraints, With transfers, Optimization and Approximiation
  * Motivation: (1) Huge package delivery demand, huge traffic congestion, resource consumption, and environmental pollution; (2) Large amount of under-utilized capacity outside the peak hours in public transportation.
  * Solution: (1) Determining four ID states of packages (waiting, riding, rewaiting, and being unloaded); (2) Heuristic for the NP problem (ILP)
* Planning City-Wide Package Distribution, *IEEE-Access, 2019*
  * Seems to be same as CPTS, *IEEE IoT Journal 2019*
* Car4Pac, *IEEE TITS 2019*
  * Taxonomy: Private cars, No time constraints, No tranfers, Graph
  * Challenges: Parcel delivery cost estimation; order dispatching.
* PPtaxi, *IEEE TMC 2019*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi, With Transfers, Graph, Time contrained not considered in design but evaluated
  * Contribution: Mulit-hop crowd delivery
* CrowdExpress, *IEEE TBD 2020*
  * Taxonomy: Taxi, No time constraints, With transfers
  * Advantages: Lower the cost and accelerate package deliveries simultaneously.
  * Solution: Build a package transport network offline based on the historical taxi GPS trajectory data;

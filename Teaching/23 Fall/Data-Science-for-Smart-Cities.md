# Course Description

Empowered by rich data collected from various infrastructures in our cities and machine learning techniques, our cities are becoming “smarter”. In this course, we discuss how data science is used to innovate our cities. We cover topics such as urban sensing, data-driven modeling and analytics for smart city services, data-driven decision-making, data visualization, and novel applications in various city phenomena. Students are expected to (i) read and present research papers drawn from top conferences, (ii) participate in discussions of the papers, and (iii) design, implement, and present their ideas for the final class project.

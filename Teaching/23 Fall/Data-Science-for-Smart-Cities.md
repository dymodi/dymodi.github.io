## Course Description

Empowered by rich data collected from various infrastructures in our cities and machine learning techniques, our cities are becoming “smarter”. In this course, we discuss how data science is used to innovate our cities. We cover topics such as urban sensing, data-driven modeling and analytics for smart city services, data-driven decision-making, data visualization, and novel applications in various city phenomena. 
Students are expected to (i) read and present research papers from top conferences, (ii) participate in discussions of the papers, and (iii) design, implement, and present their ideas for the final class project.



## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to

1. Understand the basic principle underlying data science for smart cities;
2. Explain the state-of-the-art research in this area;
3. Demonstrate ideas for smart cities;
4. Implement ideas based on real-world data using tools including but not limited to data analytics, machine learning, statistics, data visualization, etc.

In this post we introduce some similarity and dissimilarity measures. Most content come from the [Data Mining](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/index.php) from Vipin Kumar at University of Minnesota.

## Distances
* Euclidean Distance
* Minkowski Distance
* Mahalanobis Distance

Common Properties of a Distance

## Similarity Between Binary Vectors
SMC versus Jaccard

Jaccard: Compute the overlap proportion.

## Others
Cosine Similarity: a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them, **independent of magnitude**.

Correlations (linear relation)

## Information based metrics
Mutual Information

Maximal Information Coefficient

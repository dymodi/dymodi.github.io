This is a learning note of ["Machine Learning "](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) from Andrew Ng.

## Week 1 Introduction

### Introduction

#### What is Machine Learning?

#### Supervised Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning

Clustering

Non-clustering: Cocktail Party Algorithm.

### Model and Cost Function

#### Model Representation

Training Set -> Learning Algorithm -> $$h$$

#### Cost Function

### Parameter Learning

#### Gradient Descent

$$\theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha  \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} J(\theta_j)$$ 

Note: all $$\theat$$ are updated simultaneously.

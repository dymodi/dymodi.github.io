As big data practitioners, we should realize the risk in manipulating data. GDPR is one of the things we should follow.

## Personal Data

Personal data is any information that relates to an **identified or identifiable living individual**. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data.

Personal data that has been rendered **anonymous** in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymised, the anonymisation must be **irreversible**.

*[That is, if the data use in your research is anonymised, it is no longer considered as personal data]*

## Examples of personal data

- a name and surname;
- a home address;
- an email address such as [name.surname@company.com](mailto:name.surname@company.com);
- an identification card number;
- **location data** (for example the location data function on a mobile phone)*;
- an Internet Protocol (IP) address;
- a cookie ID*;
- the advertising identifier of your phone;
- data held by a hospital or doctor, which could be a symbol that uniquely identifies a person.

*[The tricky part is that location data is also considered as personal data, then how can we utilize location data while anonymize it.]*

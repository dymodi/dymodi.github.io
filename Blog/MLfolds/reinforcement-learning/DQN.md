An Introduction to Deep Q-Network (DQN) can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-dqn-deep-q-network-e207751f7ae4). 

**Q-learning** learns the action-value function $Q(s, a)$: how good to take an *action* at a particular *state*. Q is called the action-value function.

DQN is an approximation of the classic Q-learning algorithm by a neural network.



**Advantages of DQN:**

* Capable of handling high-dimensional sensory inputs (states). [1]

**Disadvantages of DQN:**

*

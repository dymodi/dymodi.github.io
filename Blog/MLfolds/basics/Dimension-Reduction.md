In this post, I will summarize some dimension reduction methods.

* PCA: Project x to z to maximize the variance
* LDA: Projection maximize within-class scatter and minimize between class scatter
* MDS: Projection keeping the orignial distances
* Isomap: Use geodesic distance along the manifold instead of Euclidean distance
* LLE: Linear patch assumption (linear combinations of neighbors)

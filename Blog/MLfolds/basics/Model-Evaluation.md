sklearn has provide a vast nunmber of [tools](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html) for model evaluation.



## Generic Measures

**Confusion Matrix**

|                  |      | **Predicted Class**		  |**Predicted Class**|
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------- | ---- |
|                  |      | + (Positive) | - (Negative) |
| **Acutal Class** | + (Positive) | TP              | FN   |
| **Acutal Class** | - (Negative) | FP              | TN   |

**Accuracy**

[Accuracy](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy) : Overall, how often is the classifier correct?. It is one (most basic) metric for evaluating classification models,

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total number of predictions}}$$

$$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$$

**True Positive Rate (TPR), Recall** In all positives,how many is classified as positive correctly: 

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$

**Precision**: When it predicts positive, how often is it correct?

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$

**False Positive Rate (FPR)** In all negetives,how many is classified as positive wrongly: 

$$\text{FPR} = \frac{FP}{FP+TN}$$

**ROC, AUC**

[ROC curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#ROC_space) is defined based on the confusion matrix focusing on TPR and FPR. 

The most important advantage for ROC is that it can show the performance of the classifier for all possible thresholds(parameters), while accuracy can only shows the performance on for certain parameter.

Area Under the Curve, or AUC, is a numerical measure to evaluate the performance of classifier. A good illustration is:

</p>

Where we have the following guide:

- .90-1 = excellent (A)
- .80-.90 = good (B)
- .70-.80 = fair (C)
- .60-.70 = poor (D)
- .50-.60 = fail (F)

A good explanation of ROC and AUC can be found [here](http://www.dataschool.io/roc-curves-and-auc-explained/).



## Metrics for Regression

Plot of Predicted vs. Real

**Quantiles for a probability plot (QQ-plot)**. [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.probplot.html)

**Residual Plots**

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

$$\text{MSE}=\frac1n\sum^n_{i=1}(Y_i-\hat Y_i)^2 $$

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

$$\text{MSE}=\frac1n\sum^n_{i=1}\left|Y_i-\hat Y_i\right|^2 $$

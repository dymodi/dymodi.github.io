Unlike model evaluation, sometimes we need to evaluate the machine learning performance from a system view.



## Reliablity

In reliability engineering, the reliability of a system is estimated by considering the dependencies between the system’s components. The probability of a system failure is then expressed in terms of the states of its components [1]. 





## Stability

A post on stability of ML system can be found [here](https://www.offconvex.org/2016/03/14/stability/).

An algorithm is *stable*, intuitively speaking, if its output doesn’t change much if we perturb the input sample in a single point. We will see that this property by itself is necessary and sufficient for generalization.

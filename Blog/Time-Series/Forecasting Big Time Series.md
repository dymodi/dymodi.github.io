## Applications

* Financial / Medical / Traffic / Weather 



## Problem 1

* Goal: given a signal (eg., #packets over time) 
* Find: patterns, periodicities, and/or compress

## Problem 2

* Forecast

## Problem 3

* Given: A set of correlated time sequences
* Forecast one of them.

## Important Observations:

* Problems are related;

* Feature extraction =

  *= (lossy) compression
   = Dimensionality reduction
   = Embedding
   = Latent/hidden variable detection = AutoEncoding*

  ...

Question: Find quickly stocks like ‘C’ (or customers like ‘smith’)

Answer: Summarize seq. to a few numbers/features (eg., avg, stdv, Fourier coeff.)

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP and studied widely in the operation research community.

A classical approach to solve TSP is using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).

Gurobi provides a nice [ILP formulation](http://examples.gurobi.com/traveling-salesman-problem/), while Google also has a [blog](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/tsp) on this topic.

Some discussion about subtour elimination constraints can be found [here](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/methods/opt/subtour.htm),

Tabu Search is a meta-heuristic that guides a local heuristic search procedure to explore the solution space beyond local optimality [1].

A very impressive [introduction of Tabu search](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/discrete-optimization/ls-8-iterated-location-search-metropolis-heuristic-simulated-annealing-tabu-BtJDc) (and other discrete optimization methods) are provided by Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck.

The basic idea of tabu search is to maintain a tabu (forbidden) list to avoid circulating around local minima by putting the previous steps in the tabu list. In tabu search, each solution $$x$$ has an associated neighborhood $$N(x)\sub X$$ , and each solution $$x'\in N(x)$$ is reached from $$x$$ by an operation called a *move*.

One major problem is that sometime it is too costly to maintain all the visiting history hence a improvement is to maintain a short-term memory and only keep recent visits. While sometimes it is still not efficient to keep the whole configuration (the whole $$x$$), then we can only keep the abstraction of the previous configurations. For example, we can only keep the swap operations in the when $$x$$ is a sequence.



### Key Points

* Cost function $$f(x)$$
* Initialization
* Short-Term Memory
  * The solutions that have been searched
* Long-Term Memory

  * Intensification: Store high-quality solutions and return to them periodically
  * Diversification: When the search is not producing improvement, make a big change of the current state.
  * Strategic oscillation: change the precentage of time spent in the feasible and infeasible regions.
* Aspiration

  * Sometimes one configuration is so good that even it is in the tabu list but we still want to accept it, we can use a technique called "aspiration" to take some extremely good configuration outside the tabu list.

According to Wikipedia, a **dense graph** is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges. The opposite, a graph with only a few edges, is a **sparse graph**.



In [1], an algorithm is designed to find the dense subgraph from the whole graph to find the communities on WWW.

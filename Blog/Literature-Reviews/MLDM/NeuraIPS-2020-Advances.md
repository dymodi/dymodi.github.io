Personal summary and notes based on a glance through all [2020 NeuraIPS papers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020).

**New Key Words**

* Coresets [Coresets-1, 2, 3 ];
  * Coreset is a small data-set that can represent the characteristics of the orginal large data-set.

* Agnostic Learning [Agnostic-1,2]  
  * The core idea seems to be that the learning objective is hard to grasp. For example, label distribution unknown in test set.

**Related Applications (Transportation/Mobility/Sensor/IoT/Cyber-Physical-System/On-Device-Learning)**

* Vehicle Routing with RL. [Reinforcement-1]
* Traffic Light Control with RL. [Reinforcement-2]
* Dynamic Community Detection [Graph-5]
* Sensor Coordination [Reinforcement-4]
* MCUNet: Tiny Deep Learning on IoT Devices [IoT-1]
* STLnet: Signal Temporal Logic Enforced Multivariate RNN [Recurrent-1] (*John Stankovic's work*)
* On-Device Learning [IoT-2]

**Interesting Ideas**

* "Neural Networks Fail to Learn Periodic Functions and How to Fix It" [Activations-1]
* "Hateful Memes Challenge" [Challenge-1]
* "Play MOBA Games." [Reinforcement-2]
* "What is being transferred in transfer learning?." [Transfer-1]
* "Interior Point Solving for LP-based prediction+optimisation" [Math-1]
* "Learning from Aggregate Observations"(*single lable for multiple instances*) [Aggregate-1]

**Advances in Existing Field**

* Graph Learning.
  * Pointer Graph Networks (PGN) [Graph-1]
  * Natural Graph Networks [Graph-2]

  * Robust Aggregation [Graph-7]
  * Random Walk Graph Neural Networks [Graph-8]
  * [Open Graph Benchmark](https://ogb.stanford.edu/) [Graph-9]
* Autoencoder
  * Variational Autoencoder: the encoded variable is not a value but a probability. [VAE-1,2]
* BERT
  * Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth [BERT-1]

**Key Words**: 

* Location-based social networks (LBSNs)
* Geo-Social Correlation



In LBSNs, researchers focus on the correlation between users' spatial location (check-in behavior) and social networks (Twitter texts, etc.)

A related works is utilizing user's social information in improving location prediction performance [1, 2, 3, 4]. 



## Differences

There are two main differences:

1. In LBSNs, the user's locations are analyzed and predicted in a social network view. Specifically, features they utilzed are previous check-in or friends check-in. However, we analyze and detect the user's location based on the user's own behavior. This is made possible since more behevior are conducted on the cellphone end like payment and navigation. That is, massive data can be collected on user behavior.
2. Since the application is to provide anchor, the frequence of our prediction on user's location is much higher than that in LBSNs, leading to a problem of lacking labels in training.

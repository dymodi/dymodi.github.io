Reading papers is an essential part of a Ph.D. student's life, especially for junior students.

Here I provide a list of papers that I encourage you to read. I will also provide a reason to recommend the paper.



Hidasi, Bal√°zs, et al. "Session-based recommendations with recurrent neural networks." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06939* (2015).

Reason: 

1. High-citation work, first work on utilizing RNN for Recommender systems.
2. Clear presentation on problem, challenge, SoTA, and opportunities



Vaswani, Ashish, et al. "Attention is all you need." *Advances in neural information processing systems* 30 (2017).



He, Kaiming, et al. "Deep residual learning for image recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition*. 2016.

Reason:

1. High-citation work.

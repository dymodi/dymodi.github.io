My research interests Broadly interested in the **Cyber-Physical Systems** (also known as **Internet of Things**) and **Human Centered Computing** from *Mobile* and *Ubiquitous Computing* perspectives with applications in *Smart Cities*.

As shown in the figure, my works involve all three phases in the **human-centered cyber-physical systems** framework, i.e., sensing, prediction, and decision-making. Focused on the interaction between the couriers and the delivery system, I have solved multiple essential problems in on-demand delivery.

#### aBeacon [NSDI'21], a 3-year Citywide Wireless Beacon System

</p>
<p>aBeacon is an operational indoor sensing system to infer the indoor status of  couriers, e.g., arrival and departure at the merchants based on Bluetooth.</p>
<p>aBeacon consists of customized BLE devices at 12,109 merchants, interacting with 109,378 couriers to infer their status to assist the scheduling of 64 million delivery orders for 7 million customers with a total amount of $600 million order values.</p>

</p>
<p>We explore to use merchants’ smartphones under their consent as a virtual infrastructure to design, build, deploy, and operate VALID, a Bluetooth-based indoor status detection system, from in-lab conception to nationwide operation.</p>
<p>During its full nationwide operation (2018/12- 2021/01), VALID consists of virtual devices at 3 million shops and restaurants, to infer and influence 1 million couriers’ behavior, and assist the scheduling of 3.9 billion orders for 186 million customers.</p>

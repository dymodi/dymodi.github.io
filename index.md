I am currently an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society ([IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/postdoctoral-associate-ssrc/)) and Media Lab from 2022 to 2023. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota in 2022. I have my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Zhejiang University in China.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **cyber-physical systems (CPS)**, **mobile computing**, and **data mining**. I am interested in studying human behavior through smartphone sensing and machine learning in CPS and cyber-human systems (CHS) like *location-based services*, *urban delivery,* and *smart cities*. Some of the future projects will study how to integrate AI models like LLM into the systems.

<span style="color:Navy">I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students starting in Fall 24. Experience in mobile computing, machine learning, and/or data mining is preferred. If you are interested, please send your CV, Statement-of-Purpose, and transcripts to yi.ding *at* utdallas *dot* edu</span>

Please find my CV [here](https://yi-ding.me/assets/files/CV_Yi.pdf).

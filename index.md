I am currently an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests lie at the intersection of  **mobile computing**, **wireless sensing**, and **machine learning**. I focus on building **perceptive mobile AI** <u>systems</u> that can sense and understand *physical environment* and *human behavior*, enabling intelligent and context-aware <u>applications</u>.

Previously, I was a Postdoc at MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society and Media Lab. I received my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. I have my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Zhejiang University in China.

<span style="color:Navy">I am looking for **one** PhD student for Fall 26, and I am also looking for self-motivated students as Research Intern and Visiting Students. Experience in mobile computing and machine learning is preferred. If you are interested, please send your CV and transcripts to yi.ding *at* utdallas *dot* edu</span>.

Please find my CV [here](https://yi-ding.me/assets/files/CV_Yi.pdf).
